# Potatoâ€™s 2024 Forecast

Inspired by [my exercise in naive forecasting for the 2022 Senate
races](https://github.com/SentientPotato/senate-forecast), I decided to
go at it again for the 2024 election. To be clear, while I am a
political scientist, I am not a professional or expert election
forecaster; you should consider this project to be for entertainment
purposes only.
